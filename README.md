Planning and development process

### User stories

- as a user I would like to search for the destination and arrival location
- as a user I would like to filter the flights based on time
- as a user I would like to get information on the flights in two ways (departing and arriving)
- as a user I would like to see the status of the flights in the table

### Planning and development process

- Day 1:
  - Looking for API and testing it.
- Day 2:
  - Found an API and displayed the data.
  - created the components.
- Day 3:
  - Worked on the search feature.
  - worked on the filter feature.
- Day 4:
  - Finalizing and styling
  - working on the readme page

### Problem-solving strategy

used console.log() to trace the errors and to check if the data is retrieved from the API

### Unsolved problems

- The styling is not as perfect as I would like it to be.
- the filter feature still needs more work.

### API used

##### [Aviation edge](http://aviation-edge.com)

I've used 3 of their APIs 

- Cities API
- Airports API
- Timetable API

### Acknowledgments

I would like to thank my instructors for being patience with me and helping me find an API, and for their constant encouragements and motivation. Also, I would like to thank my classmates for their help and support.
